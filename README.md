## 📌 Problem Statement

The pharmaceutical supply chain faces critical challenges such as counterfeit drug infiltration, 
lack of traceability, missing environmental monitoring, and data tampering. These issues compromise 
patient safety, reduce trust among stakeholders, and lead to regulatory and financial losses.

Traditional systems fail to provide real-time visibility, secure data storage, and end-to-end 
authentication from manufacturer to patient.

## 🎯 Project Objective

PharmaChain aims to build a **secure, transparent, and tamper-proof pharmaceutical supply chain system** by integrating:

- IoT-based environmental monitoring
- Blockchain-based immutable record keeping
- Role-based access for stakeholders
- Patient-level drug verification using QR codes

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔐 **End-to-End Drug Traceability**  
  Track medicine batches from manufacturing to final patient delivery.

- 🌡️ **IoT Environmental Monitoring (Simulation)**  
  Monitor temperature and humidity conditions throughout transportation.

- ⛓️ **Blockchain Ledger (Simulated)**  
  Store tamper-proof transaction records using cryptographic hashing.

- 🧑‍⚖️ **Role-Based Access Control**  
  FDA, Manufacturer, Distributor, Pharmacy, and Patient dashboards.

- 🚨 **Smart Alert System**  
  Automatic alerts when environmental parameters exceed safe limits.

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards**  
  Visual analytics for supply chain status and batch history.

- 📱 **QR Code Verification**  
  Patients can verify medicine authenticity and complete product history.

## 🧠 System Architecture

PharmaChain follows a modular and scalable architecture:

1. **Authentication Layer** – Role-based user access  
2. **Batch Management Module** – Create and transfer drug batches  
3. **IoT Simulation Module** – Sensor data generation  
4. **Blockchain Ledger Module** – Immutable record storage  
5. **Alert Engine** – Threshold-based notifications  
6. **Visualization Dashboard** – Charts and analytics  
7. **QR Verification Module** – Patient authentication

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Manufacturer creates a medicine batch with quality details  
2. IoT sensors simulate temperature and humidity data  
3. All data is stored in a secure blockchain ledger  
4. FDA reviews and approves the batch  
5. Distributor and pharmacy update delivery status  
6. Patient scans QR code to verify authenticity  
7. Alerts are triggered for unsafe conditions
